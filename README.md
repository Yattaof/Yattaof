## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi! My name is Marcel, and I'm passionate about frontend development. I love working on new projects and gaining knowledge from them.
Like most developers, I don't enjoy finding bugs in my code, but when they happen, I try to learn from them and improve. 
My goal is to become a **fullstack developer**, though I know there is still a long journey ahead! 🚀
When it comes to GitHub, I haven't used it too often since I usually save my work in the cloud. 
However, I'm familiar with GitHub and its features, and I'm ready to use it more frequently in upcoming projects! 😉

- 📚 Currently Learning: I'm continually improving my skills in the technologies I already know, especially **React** and **TypeScript**.
- 🎯 Future goal: Master **Full-Stack Development**
- 🤔 Free Time: I enjoy relaxing by playing video games (although not everyone considers that "relaxing" 😉) and spending time with my family and friends.
- 📫 How to reach me: [Email Me](mailto:marcel.mozler00@gmail.com)

## 🌟 Fun Fact!
Since I started attending IT in high school, I always said that I would never become a programmer because I didn't like programming. As you can see, visions and other aspects change! 😄
